## Design

### Architecture
![Architect class diagram](UML diagrams/OverviewClassDiagram.png)

The Architecture Diagram above gives an overview of the different components in the application. 
Details of the individual components are given below.  

Mojo class controls the overall logic for the application. 
It is responsible for 
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The rest of the App consists of 4 components:
* Login: Links the user to their account.
* Email: Stores and manages the user's email.
* Utilities: Consists of Ui, Storage and Parser helper class. Ui interacts with the user. Storage reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk. Parser parse user's input into instructions that can be understood by the application.
* Command: In charge of executing the user's request.

For these four components,
* The Login component exposes its functionality through the LoginController class.
* The Email component exposes its functionality through the EmailManager class
* The Utilities component consists of Ui, Storage and Parser classes.
* The Command component exposes its functionality through different command classes that inherit from a base Command class.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other where the user issues the command `send 1`
![Architect sequence diagram](Sequence Diagrams/OverviewSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### Utilities Component
The Utilities component contains the main classes that run the main functions of Mojo.

![Utility diagram](UML diagrams/Utilities.jpeg)

The Utilities Class Diagram given above shows how the classes in the Utilities component interact with each other and classes from other component.

The Utilities Component consists for 3 classes.

* `Parser`: Breaks down user input into relevant objects.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the local disk.
* `Ui`: Handles the input and output of the application.


### Login Component
The login component consists of the classes that run the main functions of the Login user Interface
![Login Component Class Diagram](UML diagrams/LoginComponentClassDiagram.png)
The **Login Class Diagram** give above shows how the classes in the Login Component interact with each other

The Login Component consists of 5 components.
* <code> LoginController </code> The LoginController handles the login process and control logic of the login process.
* <code> LoginManager </code> The LoginManager provides the logic to verify the user login details
* <code> LoginUi </code> The LoginUi defines the display and gets input from the user. LoginUi extends the functionality of the Ui class
* <code> LoginInfo </code> The LoginInfo contains the attributes and methods of each LoginInfo object from a particular user logging into MojoHR application
* <code> LoginInfoFileManager </code> The LoginInfoFileManager is responsible for the logic that handles the storage and retrieval of login information

### Email Component
The email component consists of classes that are involved with all the emails
![Email Component Class Diagram](UML diagrams/EmailClassDiagram.png)
The **Login Class Diagram** give above shows how the classes in the Email Component interact with each other

The Email Component consists of 8 components.
* <code> Email </code> is the parent class to the other email classes and contains all the information that is required in an email
* <code> Archive </code> inherits from Email
* <code> Deleted </code> inherits from Email
* <code> Draft </code> inherits from Email
* <code> Inbox </code> inherits from Email
* <code> Junk </code> inherits from Email
* <code> Sent </code> inherits from Email
* <code> EmailManager </code> is responsible for the logic of retrieving Emails as a whole

## Implementation

### ListCommand 
There are seven variations of the <code> list </code> command.
1. List by All email(s)
2. List by Archived email(s) 
3. List by Deleted email(s)
4. List by Draft(s) email(s) 
5. List by Inbox email(s)
6. List by Junk email(s)
7. List by Sent email(s)

The sequence diagram shows how the <code>list (type)</code> operation work. 

![ListCommand Sequence Diagram](Sequence Diagrams/ListCommand.png)

### TagCommand
`TagCommand` allows the user to tag a specific email with a number of tags.

The sequence diagram shows how the <code> tag </code> operation work.
![Tag Sequence Diagram](Sequence Diagrams/TagSequenceDiagram.png)

### ComposeCommand
When the `compose` command is entered, the software will prompt user to enter the necessary details and save them to draft.

The details needed are receiver email, subject and content. The time the draft was composed would be saved automatically.

The sequence diagram roughly shows how the `compose` operation works.

## Product Scope

### Target User Profile

{Describe the target user profile}

### Value Proposition

The HR department receives many emails from job seekers. 
A large portion of their day is spent clearing emails. Thus, our product seeks to allow the user to clear emails more efficiently by streamlining the process. 
This will reduce the time spent on clearing emails and allow HR personnel to focus on more productive things
(from clearing emails to classifying important emails).
