to see the contributed code.

### Enhancements implemented
#### 1. DeleteCommand
The delete command allows user to move an email to the delete box or remove an email from delete box forever.

1. If the displayed email list is not delete emails, move the email at the specified `INDEX` to the junk box.
2. If the displayed email list is delete emails, remove the email at the specified `INDEX` from the account forever.

#### 2. ArchiveCommand

The archive command allows user archive a not-archived email to the archive box.

1. If the displayed email list is not archived emails, move the email at the specified `INDEX` to the archive box.
2. If the displayed email list is archived emails, no action will be done.

#### 3. FindCommand
The find command `find KEYWORD`allows users to find emails that containing certain keywords.
1. Extract the keyword from user's input;
2. Look through all emails' subject or content that contains the keyword(case-ignored).
3. Return the emails;


#### 4. Check the validation of the password when resetting the password
1. User should type the old password correctly to gain the authority to modify the password;

2. The new password should not be the same as the old one.

3. The password should meet the following requirements:
    * Password should not contain any space.
    * Password should contain at least one digit(0-9).
    * Password length should be between 8 to 15 characters.
    * Password should contain at least one lowercase letter(a-z).
    * Password should contain at least one uppercase letter(A-Z).
    * Password should contain at least one special character ( @, #, %, &, !, $, etcâ€¦.)
4. update the new password in account.json file
5. update the new password in the loginInfo.txt file;

#### 6. Synchronise the data in hard disk after modifying(Data Storage)
1. Design the structure of the json file to store emails for an email account as below:
````
   {
    "password": "Aaaa123--",
    "deleted": [ ],
    "junk": [ ],
    "archive": [ ],
    "drafts": [ ],
    "inbox": [ ],
    "sent": [ ],
    "account": "123@gmail.com"
    }
````
Design the structure of the email in json file as below:
````
    {
      "read": "x",
      "subject": "This is subject 7",
      "from": "12312@gmail.com",
      "to": [
        "12332@gmail.com"
      ],
      "time": "2021-02-20T12:30:00",
      "content": "This is content for s7.",
      "tags": [
        "CS2113",
        "IMPT"
      ]
    }
````
2. Load the data from json file to ArrayList with the help of `googlecode.json-simple` package;
````
import org.json.simple.JSONArray;
import org.json.simple.JSONObject;
import org.json.simple.parser.JSONParser;
import org.json.simple.parser.ParseException;
   ````
3. Save the updated data back to the user's json file;
* Password: After resetting the new password, both user account's json file and loginInfo.txt will be updated. 


* Emails: Write a method to rewrite the whole new ArrayList of emails back to a Json Object, which should be called after command like: delete, archive, send, tag...


### Documentation
#### 1. User Guide
* Added documentation for the following features `delete`, `archive`, `find`, `reset`

#### 2. Developer Guide
* Added documentation (Architecture, Implementation, Manual Testing) for features `delete`, `archive`, `find`, `reset`


### Contributions to team-based tasks
1. Necessary general code enhancements
2. Maintaining the issue tracker
3. Updating user/developer docs that are not specific to a feature(e.g. user stories, quick start)
